This project consists of building 2 speakers that will output the audio from my PC. I am limited in circuit options since I would like to use only parts that I already have at home. It would be simple to buy an audio amp board off amazon or use op amps but I don't have those; what I do have are transistors, capacitors, diodes, and resistors. The speakers I will be using are rated at 8 Watts and 4 Ohms.

I started off with two circuits that I found online:

The impedence of my speaker will not matter much because it is in series with a 220 uF coupling capacitor. At 1000 Hz
